                    INDIA bloc of the Opposition emphasized that the Lok Sabha Speaker's post should be allocated to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)'s National Democratic Alliance (NDA) partners – the Janata Dal (United) and the Telugu Desam Party (TDP).

With 240 Lok Sabha seats, the BJP fell 32 seats short of the majority mark. N. Chandrababu Naidu and Nitish Kumar, who won 16 and 12 Lok Sabha seats respectively, emerged as crucial figures in the formation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's third government, playing pivotal roles as ‘kingmakers’.....<a href="https://www.livemint.com/politics/news/lok-sabha-speaker-june-26-janata-dal-united-jdu-telugu-desam-party-tdp-india-bloc-bjp-nda-nitish-kumar-chandrababu-naidu-11718590490946.html"> Read more.....</a>

                        Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge on Saturday claimed that the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government-led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi may fall anytime.

“People have elected Modi's minority government, it may fall anytime,” reported PTI quoting Kharge.
Kharge added that the NDA government has been formed by mistake.He (PM Modi) had himself said several times...'khichdi government'...if the majority is not there it may fall anytime. They won't take any decision. <a href="https://www.livemint.com/news/india/narendra-modi-nda-government-may-fall-anytime-warns-congress-chief-mallikarjun-kharge-11718441982798.html">Read more</a>

                            Priyanka Gandhi, sister of India's main opposition Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, is set to contest her first election, ending decades of anticipation by her supporters.
Ms Gandhi is a descendant of the Nehru-Gandhi family, India's most famous political dynasty, and her electoral debut will be closely watched.
The 52-year-old will contest the Wayanad seat in the southern Indian state of Kerala after her brother relinquishes it.
A win for Ms Gandhi would mean the presence of all three Gandhi family members in the Indian parliament.
Her mother Sonia Gandhi, former president of the Congress party, is an MP in the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the parliament.

                    After the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) ascribed the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) poor performance in Maharashtra to its alliance with the Ajit Pawar-led Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) faction, dissonant chords are now being sounded by the Maharashtra BJP leadership over the need to keep up the alliance with the NCP faction ahead of the crucial Maharashtra Assembly election later this year.
                    According to sources, Maharashtra BJP leaders, as well as leaders from Chief Minister Eknath Shinde’s Shiv Sena faction, are particularly unhappy with the lack of vote transfer in Assembly segments held by NCP MLAs.<a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/maharashtra/now-dissonance-in-maharashtra-bjp-on-need-for-alliance-with-ajit-pawars-ncp-ahead-of-assembly-election/article68303532.ece">Read more...</a>

                    <p>New Delhi: Amid the raging debate over Electronic Voting Machines (EVM), YSR Congress Party president Jagan Mohan Reddy has called for a move towards voting by paper ballots. The remark comes weeks after the YSRCP was routed in the Lok Sabha election in Andhra Pradesh and the Assembly polls held alongside.
                        Just as justice should not only be served, but should also appear to have been served, so should democracy not only prevail but must appear to be prevalent undoubtedly.
                        
                        In electoral practices across the world in almost every advanced democracy, paper ballots are used, not EVMs."Just as justice should not only be served, but should also appear to have been served, so should democracy not only prevail but must appear to be prevalent undoubtedly."

                        <p>The Lok Sabha election results of the Mumbai North West seat has triggered a political slugfest with the Opposition claiming that the Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) was tampered with during the vote counting on June 4. At the center of the Mumbai North West election result row is Ravindra Dattaram Waikar – a leader in the Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena in Maharashtra – who won the seat by just 48 votes.

                            The controversy on the Mumbai North West seat erupted following allegations that Mangesh Pandilkar, brother-in-law of Ravindra Waikar, used a mobile phone to “unlock” the EVM during vote counting.<a href="https://www.livemint.com/news/mumbai-north-west-election-result-row-and-evm-unlocking-claims-all-you-need-to-know-11718689683238.html">Read more...</a>
